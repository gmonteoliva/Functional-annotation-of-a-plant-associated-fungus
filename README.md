# Functional-annotation-of-a-plant-associated-fungus
The aim of this work has been the analysis of a fungal endophyte genome, from its assembly to the annotation and description of the different predicted functions of the coding sequences, with special attention to biological functions that may be related to the interaction of the fungus with the plant.
